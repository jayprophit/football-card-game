# FootballChess - Game Rules & Documentation

## Introduction

FootballChess is a unique tactical board game that combines the strategic elements of chess with the excitement and themes of football (soccer). Players control a team of footballers, each with movement patterns inspired by chess pieces but adapted for football tactics. The objective is to outmaneuver your opponent, gain possession of the ball, and score goals.

## Game Board

The game board represents a football pitch divided into 4 main sections:

1. **Defensive Zone** (columns 0-4): Your team's defensive third including your goal
2. **Defensive Midfield** (columns 5-9): Your team's half of the middle of the pitch
3. **Attacking Midfield** (columns 10-14): Opponent's half of the middle of the pitch
4. **Attacking Zone** (columns 15-19): Opponent's defensive third including their goal

The pitch is divided into a 20Ã—10 grid, with each square representing a position where players can move. The goal areas are located at the far ends of the pitch (columns 0 and 19) and consist of 3 squares each (rows 4, 5, and 6).

## Player Types & Movement Patterns

Each player on the pitch has a specific position and corresponding movement pattern based on chess pieces:

### Goalkeeper (GK) - King Movement
- Moves 1 square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- Special ability: Can "dive" 2 squares laterally when the ball is in shooting range
- Primarily defends the 3 goal squares

### Central Defenders (CB) - Rook Movement
- Moves up to 3 squares horizontally or vertically
- Strong defensively, limited range

### Full Backs (LB/RB) - Bishop Movement
- Moves up to 3 squares diagonally
- Special ability: Can also move 1 square horizontally
- Provides width in defense and attack

### Defensive Midfielder (CDM) - Knight Movement
- Moves in L-shape (like a chess knight): 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular
- Special ability: Can also move 1 square in any direction
- Provides defensive cover and links defense to attack

### Central Midfielder (CM) - Queen Movement (Limited)
- Moves up to 2 squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- Versatile player for building attacks and defending

### Attacking Midfielder (CAM) - Queen Movement (Extended)
- Moves up to 3 squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- Creative playmaker with extended range

### Wingers (LW/RW) - Knight Movement
- Moves in L-shape (like a chess knight): 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular
- Special ability: Can also move 2 squares horizontally
- Provides width in attack and speed on counterattacks

### Striker (ST) - Rook Movement (Extended)
- Moves up to 4 squares horizontally or vertically
- Special ability: Can also move 1 square diagonally
- Focused on getting into scoring positions

## Game Setup

1. Each team starts with 11 players in a formation of their choice (e.g., 4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.)
2. The home team kicks off the match with the ball in possession of one of their central players
3. Teams are positioned in their respective halves of the pitch

## Basic Rules

### Turn Structure
1. Teams alternate taking turns
2. Each team gets 3 moves per turn
3. A move consists of moving one player according to their movement pattern
4. The team with the ball must move the player with the ball at least once during their turn
5. Multiple players can occupy the same square

### Ball Possession
- The ball is always with a player or on a specific square
- The team with more players on a square controls the ball
- When a player with the ball moves, the ball moves with them
- Players can pass the ball to teammates (counts as one move)

### Passing the Ball
1. Passing counts as one move
2. The ball can be passed to any teammate within line of sight
3. Passing over opponents increases the risk of interception
4. The pass intercepted if opponents have more players along the pass path

### Shooting
1. Shooting can only be done from within the attacking zone (last 4 columns)
2. The shot must target one of the 3 goal squares
3. Shot success probability depends on:
   - Number of defenders in the goal area
   - Goalkeeper position
   - Distance from goal

### Scoring a Goal
- A goal is scored when a shot successfully enters one of the 3 goal squares
- After a goal, play restarts with a kickoff by the conceding team

## Fouls & Cards

### Types of Fouls
1. **Soft Foul**: Occurs when teams have equal numbers on a square and contest possession
   - Result: Warning or yellow card if in a scoring position
   
2. **Hard Foul**: Occurs when the attacking team has one more player on a square than the defending team
   - Result: Yellow card, or red card if in a scoring position
   
3. **Injury Foul**: Occurs when the attacking team has two or more extra players on a square than the defending team
   - Result: Red card and potential injury to a defending player

### Card System
- **Yellow Card**: First warning. Player remains on the pitch but must be more careful.
- **Second Yellow Card**: Results in a red card and the player is sent off.
- **Red Card**: Player is immediately sent off and team must play with 10 players.

### Injury System
1. **Minor Injury**: Player continues but with reduced movement (one less square in range)
   - Recovery: Automatic after a few turns
   
2. **Serious Injury**: Player may need to be substituted
   - 50% chance the player needs to be taken off
   - Recovery: Multiple matches in season mode
   
3. **Season-Ending Injury**: Player must be removed from the match
   - Recovery: Unavailable for the remainder of the season in season mode

## Match Flow

### Kickoff
- The match begins with a kickoff from the center circle
- The team kicking off gets the first 3 moves
- After a goal, the conceding team takes the kickoff

### Half-Time
- Occurs after approximately 45 minutes of match time (turn-based simulation)
- Teams switch sides for the second half
- Away team typically kicks off the second half

### Full-Time
- Match ends after approximately 90 minutes of match time
- The team with the most goals wins
- Draws are possible in friendly matches

## Advanced Tactics

### Formations
Different formations provide different strategic advantages:
- **4-4-2**: Balanced approach with good defensive coverage and two strikers
- **4-3-3**: More attacking with three forwards for pressing and counterattacks
- **3-5-2**: Stronger midfield control with wing-backs providing width
- **5-3-2**: Defensive setup with more players in the back line

### Pressing
- Move multiple players into the same area to outnumber opponents
- Forces turnovers in dangerous areas
- Risk: Can leave spaces behind if unsuccessful

### Counter-Attacking
- Absorb pressure in defensive areas
- Win the ball and quickly transition forward
- Use players with extended movement ranges (strikers, wingers) to break quickly

### Possession Play
- Keep the ball by maintaining triangles of players
- Gradually build up attacks through midfield
- Patience and careful positioning are key
