# FootballChess: A Tactical Football Card Game

## Game Overview
FootballChess is a unique hybrid of chess and football (soccer) where players manage a team of footballers represented by cards. Each player has distinct movement patterns based on their position, inspired by chess pieces but adapted for football tactics. The game can be played on web, mobile, or desktop platforms.

## Game Board
- The board represents a football pitch divided into 4 main sections
- Each section contains individual squares where cards can be placed
- The grid is proportioned based on a standard football pitch
- The goalkeeper defends 3 specific squares that form the goal area

## Player Cards
Each card represents a football player with:
- Position (determines movement pattern)
- Base stats (all players of the same position start with identical stats)
- Team colors and branding
- Special abilities (if any)

### Player Movement Patterns (Based on Chess Pieces)

| Position | Base Movement Pattern | Additional Movements |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Goalkeeper | King (1 square in any direction) | Can dive 2 squares when ball is in shooting range |
| Central Defender | Rook (horizontal and vertical) | Limited to 3 squares per move |
| Wing Back/Full Back | Bishop (diagonal) | Can also move 1 square horizontally |
| Defensive Midfielder | Knight (L-shape) | Can also move 1 square in any direction |
| Central Midfielder | Queen (any direction) | Limited to 2 squares per move |
| Attacking Midfielder | Queen (any direction) | Limited to 3 squares per move |
| Winger | Knight (L-shape) | Can also move 2 squares horizontally |
| Striker | Rook (horizontal and vertical) | Can also move 1 square diagonally |

## Gameplay

### Basic Rules
1. The match starts with kickoff formation
2. The kickoff team makes 3 consecutive moves
3. The opposing team then makes 3 consecutive moves
4. Turns alternate with 3 moves per team
5. Multiple cards can occupy the same square
6. The team with more cards on a square controls the ball

### Ball Possession and Movement
- Ball movement occurs through passing or dribbling
- Passing: Move the ball directly to another player's square
- Dribbling: Player with ball moves according to their movement pattern
- Shooting: Attempt to move the ball into one of the 3 goalkeeper squares

### Fouls and Cards
- **Soft Foul**: Attempting to tackle with equal number of cards on a square
  - Results in warning or yellow card if in scoring position
- **Hard Foul**: Attempting to tackle with just one more card than opponent
  - Results in yellow card or red card if in scoring position
- **Injury Foul**: Attempting to tackle with two or more extra cards than opponent
  - Results in red card and potential injury to opponent

### Injury System
- **Minor Injury**: Player continues but with reduced movement (one less square)
- **Serious Injury**: Player may need to be substituted depending on injury type
- **Unable to Continue**: Player removed from match and unavailable for future matches in a season mode
