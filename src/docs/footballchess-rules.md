# FootballChess: Game Rules

## Overview
FootballChess is a strategic board game that combines the tactical elements of chess with the dynamics of football (soccer). Players take turns moving their players across a football pitch grid, passing the ball, tackling opponents, and attempting to score goals.

## Game Board
- The game is played on a 20×10 grid representing a football pitch
- The pitch is divided into 4 zones: Defensive Zone, Defensive Midfield, Attacking Midfield, and Attacking Zone
- Each team has a goal area consisting of 3 squares at each end of the pitch

## Teams
- Each team consists of 11 players with different positions:
  - 1 Goalkeeper (GK)
  - 4 Defenders (CB, LB, RB)
  - 3 Midfielders (CDM, CM, CAM)
  - 2 Wingers (LW, RW)
  - 1 Striker (ST)
- Each player has a rating (75-99) that affects their performance
- Players have a squad number displayed on their card

## Movement Rules
Each player type has a unique movement pattern based on chess pieces:

1. **Goalkeeper (GK):**
   - Moves like a King (1 square in any direction)
   - Limited to moving within the goal area (3×3 area)

2. **Defenders (CB, LB, RB):**
   - Center Backs move like Rooks (horizontally and vertically)
   - Full Backs move like Bishops (diagonally)
   - Limited to 4 squares maximum movement

3. **Midfielders (CDM, CM, CAM):**
   - Move like Queens (any direction)
   - Limited to 3 squares maximum movement

4. **Wingers (LW, RW):**
   - Move like Knights (L-shape) plus horizontal movement
   - Can move 2 squares horizontally

5. **Striker (ST):**
   - Moves like a King but with extended range (2 squares)
   - Can move in any direction up to 2 squares

## Ball Possession and Movement
- Only one player can possess the ball at any time
- The ball moves with the player who possesses it
- Multiple players can occupy the same square
- If a player with the ball moves to a square with opponent players, possession is determined by which team has more players in the square

## Turn Structure
1. Each turn consists of 3 moves for one team
2. After 3 moves, the turn switches to the opposing team
3. Each move can be:
   - Moving a player (following their movement pattern)
   - Passing the ball to a teammate
   - Shooting at goal (if in shooting range)

## Passing
- A player with the ball can pass to any visible teammate
- Pass success probability depends on:
  - Distance (shorter passes are more successful)
  - Number of opponents in the passing lane
  - Player rating
- Failed passes may be intercepted by opponents or go loose

## Shooting
- Players can shoot when they are in the attacking third of the pitch
- Shot success depends on:
  - Shooter's rating
  - Goalkeeper's rating
  - Number of defenders in the area
  - Distance and angle to goal
- If a shot is saved, the opposing goalkeeper gains possession

## Tackling and Fouls
Three types of fouls can occur during tackles:

1. **Soft Foul:**
   - Results in a warning or yellow card
   - More severe if in a scoring position

2. **Hard Foul:**
   - Results in a yellow or red card
   - Automatic red card if in a scoring position

3. **Injury Foul:**
   - Results in a red card
   - Injured player may be affected

## Injury System
Players can suffer three levels of injuries:

1. **Minor Injury:**
   - Player continues with reduced effectiveness

2. **Serious Injury:**
   - Player may need to be substituted
