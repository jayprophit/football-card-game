## 3D Implementation Details

### Three.js Integration
The 3D visualization will be implemented using Three.js with React Three Fiber for component-based rendering:

```jsx
// Example of a 3D player component
const PlayerModel = ({ position, teamColor, isSelected, hasBall }) => {
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF('/models/player.glb');
  const ref = useRef();
  
  // Animation states
  const [animation, setAnimation] = useState('idle');
  
  // Update animations based on game state
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isSelected) setAnimation('selected');
    else if (hasBall) setAnimation('withBall');
    else setAnimation('idle');
  }, [isSelected, hasBall]);

  return (
    <group 
      position={[position.x, 0, position.y]} 
      ref={ref}
    >
      <mesh
        geometry={nodes.PlayerBody.geometry}
        material={materials.PlayerMaterial}
        material-color={teamColor}
      >
        {/* Player number or position indicator */}
        <Text
          position={[0, 1.5, 0]}
          fontSize={0.2}
          color="#ffffff"
        >
          {position.number}
        </Text>
        
        {/* Selected highlight effect */}
        {isSelected && (
          <mesh position={[0, -0.5, 0]}>
            <ringGeometry args={[0.6, 0.7, 32]} />
            <meshBasicMaterial color="#ffff00" />
          </mesh>
        )}
        
        {/* Ball if player has possession */}
        {hasBall && (
          <mesh position={[0.3, 0.1, 0.3]}>
            <sphereGeometry args={[0.1, 32, 32]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color="#ffffff" />
          </mesh>
        )}
      </mesh>
    </group>
  );
};
```

### Camera System
Multiple camera views will be available:

```jsx
const GameCamera = ({ cameraMode, targetPosition }) => {
  const cameraRef = useRef();
  
  // Update camera based on selected mode
  useEffect(() => {
    switch(cameraMode) {
      case 'topDown':
        cameraRef.current.position.set(0, 15, 0);
        cameraRef.current.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
        break;
      case 'sideline':
        cameraRef.current.position.set(12, 3, 0);
        cameraRef.current.lookAt(0, 1, 0);
        break;
      case 'follow':
        // Follow the selected player or ball
        if (targetPosition) {
          cameraRef.current.position.set(
            targetPosition.x + 3, 
            5, 
            targetPosition.y + 3
          );
          cameraRef.current.lookAt(
            targetPosition.x,
            0,
            targetPosition.y
          );
        }
        break;
    }
  }, [cameraMode, targetPosition]);

  return (
    <PerspectiveCamera
      ref={cameraRef}
      fov={60}
      aspect={window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight}
      near={0.1}
      far={1000}
      makeDefault
    />
  );
};
```

## Offline Mode Implementation

To enable offline play, we'll implement a comprehensive data persistence system:

1. **Local Storage**: Game state and progress saved locally
2. **IndexedDB**: For larger assets and game data
3. **Service Workers**: For web to enable offline functionality
4. **Native Storage**: Using AsyncStorage (React Native) and Electron's filesystem API

```typescript
// Service for managing offline data
export class OfflineDataService {
  // Save current game state
  async saveGameState(gameState: GameState): Promise<void> {
    if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
      localStorage.setItem('currentGame', JSON.stringify(gameState));
    } else if (Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'android') {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('currentGame', JSON.stringify(gameState));
    } else {
      // Electron
      await window.electron.filesystem.writeFile(
        'gameState.json',
        JSON.stringify(gameState)
      );
    }
  }
  
  // Load saved game state
  async loadGameState(): Promise<GameState | null> {
    let savedState = null;
    
    if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
      const data = localStorage.getItem('currentGame');
      if (data) savedState = JSON.parse(data);
    } else if (Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'android') {
      const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem('currentGame');
      if (data) savedState = JSON.parse(data);
    } else {
      // Electron
      const exists = await window.electron.filesystem.exists('gameState.json');
      if (exists) {
        const data = await window.electron.filesystem.readFile('gameState.json');
        savedState = JSON.parse(data);
      }
    }
    
    return savedState;
  }
  
  // Additional methods for team data, player customizations, etc.
}
```

## Player Customization System

The player customization feature will allow users to create custom players using device camera or uploaded photos:

```typescript
export class PlayerCustomizationService {
  // Convert photo to player avatar texture
  async createPlayerAvatarFromPhoto(photoUri: string): Promise<string> {
    // Process the photo (crop, resize, optimize)
    const processedImage = await ImageProcessor.process(photoUri, {
      width: 256,
      height: 256,
      format: 'png'
    });
    
    // Save processed image
    const avatarPath = await this.saveProcessedAvatar(processedImage);
    
    return avatarPath;
  }
  
  // Apply avatar to 3D player model
  applyAvatarToPlayerModel(playerId: string, avatarPath: string): void {
    // Find the player in the game state
    const player = gameState.players.find(p => p.id === playerId);
    
    if (player) {
      player.avatarTexture = avatarPath;
      
      // Update the 3D model texture
      const playerMesh = scene.getObjectByName(`player-${playerId}`);
      if (playerMesh) {
        const texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(avatarPath);
        playerMesh.material.map = texture;
        playerMesh.material.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## GitHub Codespaces Setup

To make the project testable via GitHub Codespaces, we'll include:

1. A `.devcontainer` configuration
2. GitHub Actions workflows for testing
3. A development server that launches automatically

```json
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "FootballChess Development",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:18",
  "forwardPorts": [3000, 19000, 19001, 19002],
