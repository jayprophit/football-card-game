# 3D Graphical Style Guide

## Visual Design Philosophy
- Stylized 3D graphics
- Vibrant and energetic color palette
- Cartoon-like character design
- Smooth and dynamic animations
- Performance-optimized rendering

## Character Design Principles
1. Stylized Player Characters
   - Exaggerated proportions
   - Distinctive silhouettes
   - Vibrant team color schemes
   - Highly expressive animations

2. Character Archetypes
   - Goalkeeper: Larger, more robust build
   - Defenders: Muscular, solid stance
   - Midfielders: Agile, dynamic posture
   - Forwards: Lean, explosive movement

## Visual Style Characteristics
- Low-Poly Aesthetic
